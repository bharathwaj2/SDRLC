# SDRLC
RL-CBF safe controller for planetary rovers.

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper, "R. K. Jana, R. Majumder, B. K S and S. Sundaram, "Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Controller (SDRLC) for Autonomous Navigation of Planetary Rovers," 2024 IEEE Space, Aerospace and Defence Conference (SPACE), Bangalore, India, 2024, pp. 799-803, doi: 10.1109/SPACE63117.2024.10668292". 

Two different kinematic models have been used for training, Point mass and Unicycle. Each model has two different environments, single obstacle and multiple obstacle (MO). The environment can be choosed specifically while running Train.py and Test.py.
